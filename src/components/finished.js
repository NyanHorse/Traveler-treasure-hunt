              1900, it's a reflection of Gaudí's artistic plenitude, which
              belongs to his naturalist phase.There are two houses in the
              complex, one was intended to be a show house, other one was Gaui's
              house where he lived with hos family from 1906 to 1926. It is now
              the Gaudi House Museum since 1963.
